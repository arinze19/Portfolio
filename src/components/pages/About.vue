    <h2>Who?</h2>
    <p>
      So, who is this guy, you may be wondering . well to put it simply, I am a
      web developer obsessed with making pixel perfect interfaces for web users.
      <br />
      I write my code majorly in JavaScript and use Vue extensively for the
      front-end of my projects(It's really that good guys).
      <br />
      I write API's occasionally and my REST API's are written in NodeJs. I also
      use MongoDB and Firebase as my databases.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I'm not deep in thought thinking about why my code doesn't work the
      way i want it to(they work eventually at the end of the day or week...or
      month. and the satisfaction that comes when they finally work is really
      unrivaled) i usually read about start-ups
      <a href="https://stearsng.com">Here üìà</a> and watch movies
      <a href="https://netflix.com">Here üé¨</a>, and a huge fan of coldplay, even
      made a project on them here. I contribute and give back to community using
      <a href="https://kwanda.co" target="_blank">Kwanda</a>.
      <br />
      I'm really passionate about building products that positively affect lives
      using software and stay up to date with the latest technology
    </p>
    <p>
      If you read this up to this point then that's really impressive. have a
      question or want to colaborate on making products that affect millions of
      people positively?
